# CS3035 â€“ Course Project Description

## Description of Your Project

Below, provide a short description of what your project is, how it works, and why you selected this as your project.

In Ice Hockey, teams often keep track of where they and their opponents are getting scoring chances from.
This helps them work on their positioning and improve their game.
I built an app that lets team managers see these scoring chances visually and keep note of important plays throughout a game.
The user clicks on the ice surface to add a shot or goal and can add notes to the Game Report list. 
All events are timestamped and the scoreboard updates automatically. 
I selected this project because I like the sport and knew somewhat about the topic. 

## Requirements

- How/What different views did you provide for some aspect of your model?
    I have an instructionsScreenView (About and Help Info), a rinkView (Dry Board / Ice Surface), a splashScreen view and a mainView
    I avoid FXML in favor of java classes to keep it simple.

- What custom widget did you create in your application?
    A custom button that changes color when the mouse is over it

- What are the different domain objects that can be created/edited in 
your application?

    Text and Labels for period, time, goals and shots.
    Custom button to change scenes
    ListView to see all game events 
    ToggleButtons to select home and away shots and goals
    Button to add notes 
    Buttons to start and stop a timer 
    Menu Items to clear dry board, scoreboard and game report
    Menu Item to select period
    Menu Item to go to help/ about scene
    TextField to enter notes
    

- What parts of the application/project did you find particularly challenging? 
And, what would you have liked to improve?

 I found it challenging to keep my code organized when working on a larger project.
 With more time I would clean up my code and change up the design better contrast colors
 
- Any  other comments on the course mini project?
